4. For anyone:
Track a product's current stage and history using its ID


## Smart Contract
The application interacts with a Solidity smart contract named ICOMarket. The contract's ABI and address are imported from the constants file. Ensure your smart contract is deployed on a compatible Ethereum network (e.g., Sepolia testnet) and update the contract address in the .env.local file.

### Prerequisites
- Have a computer and internet connection
- Have a basic knowledge of TypeScript
- Have a basic knowledge of Solidity
- Have a general understanding of what testing is
- Have visual-studio code or any other code editor installed on your computer.

### Smart Contract
The application interacts with a Solidity smart contract named Liquidity marketPlace. Ensure that your smart contract is deployed on a compatible Ethereum network and update the contract address in the .env.local file.

### Setup
- Open your terminal in the folder where you want to have the project and run `https://github.com/bruk19/liquidity-marketPlace-frontend.git` to clone the project.
- Run `liquidity-marketPlace-frontend` to move to the project directory.
